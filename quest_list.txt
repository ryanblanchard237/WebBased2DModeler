This is a list of features I want to add to the program.
--------------------------------------------------------

The next thing I want to try to do with this program is, add "snapping".

For example.
If you already have a rectangle drawn and you want to add a circle. And you want
the circle center to be the same as one corner of the rectangle.
Basically snapping (snap to) provides the functionality that does that.

-- Probably need to rework some of the exisiting base gemoetry so that
   all points... (more edetial ehre) are logged. (Actually *shwoing* the points
   on the drawing area might be a different thing but we probably need to start tracking all points.)





Also at some point want to add
-- translation of the sketch. (Move left/right and up/down.)
-- Scaling (zoom).
-- I guess rotation screw it might as well.

With translation...
  drag-and-move with the mouse      sure
  move with the arrow keys          mahybe sure could take a look at it.
  
Zoom
  The mouse wheel would be natural.
  On Google Maps I can use the minus and plus signs (hyphen and plus signs) to zoom.
    And I kinda like that ability.
    
    if (mouse_is_over_the_canvas and the_program_is_capturing_mouse_inputs_for_sketch_translation_and_scaling)
    { }

  Checkbox for "mouse to move/zoom".
  Add/Remove event listener.
  
  
  
Related to setting the coordinates for a mouse click...
It sounds like you cannot programmaticlly set the position of the mouse on the page.

But I still might be able to just let the user enter the coordinates for the next quote-unquote "click"...
...and then just take it from there.  
  
  
  
  
Bottom status bar.



















If I eventually take this into 3D...

  3 points defines a plane.
  4 points defines a solid.
    - If you have 4 points, you can figure out if a 5th point is inside them or not. (If the 5th one
      is inside the solid that's formed by the 4 points... or not.)
      (Similarly, you could figure out    for 3 points / a plane    whether another point (a 4th point)
      is in the same plane, or not.
