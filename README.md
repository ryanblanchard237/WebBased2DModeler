# WebBased2DModeler

2D drawing/modelling software that runs in your web browser. Since I am poor and it costs money to host a website,
I've just been sticking it here on Github... (as far as I know, there's no rule against that? Since I'm sort of using Github
to host this?)

Anyways. If you want to use it, clone the repo and just open the index.html file with your preferred web browser.
