# WebBased2DModeler

2D drawing/modelling software that runs in your web browser. Since I am poor and it costs money to host a website,
I've just been sticking it here on Github... (as far as I know, there's no rule against that? Since I'm sort of using Github
to host this?)

Anyways. If you want to use it, clone the repo (if you are less computer-programming-inclined, this means download the ZIP file using the options that show up when you click the green "Code" button at the top of this page) and just open the index.html file with your preferred web browser.

The "quest list" file is a list of future idea for it. "Quest list" because to me it's sort of like a video game. I've just been
building this thing because it's something to fill up some of my free time with.
